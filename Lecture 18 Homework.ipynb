    "$8$. Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20 % on the training data and 30 % on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neigh- bors (i.e. $K$ = 1) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations?<br>Why?\n",
